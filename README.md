# Neural_Network
neural network

This Neural Network contains an input layer, an output layer, and one hidden layer. The size or each layer can
be set when constructing the Network. The network is trainned with two NNMatrix objects. one contains training
input and the other output. The network adjusts the weights used to propagate the input through the matrix so
that when given input, it can correctly predict the output. After trainning, NNTrainingData is returned containing
information about the training. The included information is the duration the training took, the number of iterations
that occurred, and the error of each iteration.
